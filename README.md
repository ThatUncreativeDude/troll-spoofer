# Troll Spoofer

## What is Troll Spoofer?
It's a very basic HWID spoofer, I used this project to help understand the fundamentals in Python and it's designed to evade basic tools

## OMG WILL THIS WORK ON BE/EAC/VANGUARD???
Absolutely not, just look at the code. Do you think this would work on any anti-cheat or anti-spoofer? This is supposed to be used in games without checks against spoofers.

## What would it take to make it undetected or harder to detect?
A complete rewrite would be required, the code is pretty basic so the only shot you really have is to just fork it and literally do 99.99% of the work and I'm not even sure after all of that it'll work

## What can I use this for?
Getting infinite free trials, that's why it's called Troll Spoofer. Simply create new accounts every time you need a new trial and spoof your serials.

## False Positive Risk
Do note, if you have a EAC or BE protected game running and then you run this spoofer, it is very likely your account will be disabled so make sure all anti-cheats are closed before doing anything.

## Is there any other spoofers that work on EAC or BE?
You would have to check yourself, but believe me. You will never find an open source or free undetected HWID spoofer. If you really wanna get a cheat or HWID spoofer, you have to be ready to spend some cash.
